Efficient Terrain Rendering and Chunking, Ryan Kenney

The terrain drawing function in MyGL ultimately draws every terrain generation zone in m_generatedTerrain through the Terrain draw function. At each tick, all terrain generation zones that are not around the player are deleted, and if there are too few, then new ones are created by creating or loading all of its chunks. To create the VBO data for a chunk, every block is checked and every adjacent empty block adds a face to the VBO. In order to only load one VBO, the position one was chosen; I attempted to create a separate vertex handle for referencing all info, but it ultimately caused the program to crash (although this was likely due to another problem fixed later). As such, the interleaved draw function references the data stored in the position VBO for all attributes.
